## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to our project's code of conduct:

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Provide constructive feedback
- Focus on the best outcomes for the project
- Maintain professionalism in all interactions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start contributing, make sure you have:

1. A GitHub account
2. Git installed on your local machine
3. Python 3.12 or higher
4. Familiarity with our [Development Guide](./Development_Guide)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

Follow the [Development Guide](./Development_Guide) to set up your local development environment.

## Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions, including:

- **Bug fixes**: Addressing existing issues
- **Feature additions**: Implementing new functionality
- **Documentation improvements**: Enhancing or correcting documentation
- **Tests**: Adding or improving test coverage
- **Performance improvements**: Optimizing existing code
- **Refactoring**: Improving code quality without changing functionality

## Contribution Process

### 1. Find or Create an Issue

Start by finding an existing issue to work on or create a new one if you've identified a bug or enhancement opportunity.

When creating a new issue:
- Use a clear, descriptive title
- Provide detailed steps to reproduce if it's a bug
- Include expected and actual behavior
- Add screenshots if applicable
- Mention your environment (OS, Python version, etc.)

### 2. Fork the Repository

Fork the Sourcing Agent repository to your GitHub account.

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sourcing-agent.git

# Add the original repository as an upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/RiseNow-Dev/sourcing-agent.git
```

### 3. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your contribution:

```bash
# Ensure you're starting from the latest main
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the change you're making:
- `feature/add-new-tool`
- `fix/error-handling-bug`
- `docs/improve-readme`

### 4. Make Your Changes

Implement your changes following our coding standards and guidelines:

- Follow the [style guide](#coding-standards)
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation to reflect your changes
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### 5. Test Your Changes

Ensure all tests pass and that your changes don't introduce any regressions:

```bash
# Run the linters
make lint

# Run the tests
make test

# Run coverage checks
make test_coverage
```

### 6. Commit Your Changes

Make commits with clear, descriptive messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add search tool for Brave API integration"
```

Follow these commit message guidelines:
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Be descriptive but concise
- Reference issue numbers if applicable ("Fix #123: Improve error handling")

### 7. Push to Your Fork

Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 8. Submit a Pull Request

Create a pull request from your branch to the main Sourcing Agent repository:

1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Select your branch
3. Click "Pull Request"
4. Fill out the PR template with details about your changes
5. Link any related issues

Your PR should:
- Have a clear title and description
- Detail what changes were made and why
- Mention any breaking changes
- Include any necessary migration steps

### 9. Code Review

After submitting your PR:
- Maintainers will review your code
- Address any requested changes
- Respond to comments and questions
- Update your PR with additional commits if needed

### 10. Merge

Once your PR is approved:
- A maintainer will merge your PR

- Add docstrings to all functions, classes, and modules
- Follow [Google-style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings)
- Update README and documentation to reflect changes
- Include examples for new functionality

### Testing

All new code should include tests:

- Write unit tests for new functions and classes

- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
- Aim for high test coverage

## Working with Issues

### Issue Labels

We use the following labels to categorize issues:

- `bug`: Something isn't working as expected
- `enhancement`: New feature or improvement
- `documentation`: Documentation improvements
- `good first issue`: Issues suitable for first-time contributors
- `help wanted`: Issues where we need assistance
- `in progress`: Issues being actively worked on

### Issue Workflow

1. **Triage**: New issues are reviewed and categorized
2. **Assignment**: Issues are assigned to contributors
3. **Implementation**: Assigned contributor works on the issue
4. **Review**: Changes are reviewed by maintainers
5. **Closure**: Issue is closed after the PR is merged

## Getting Help

If you need assistance:

- Ask questions in the issue you're working on
- Reach out to the maintainers
- Check existing documentation and examples

## Recognition

We value all contributions and maintain a list of contributors in our README. Your contributions will be acknowledged!
