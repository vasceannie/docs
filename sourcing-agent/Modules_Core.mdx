# Core Module

This module provides the core components for building agent-based applications using a graph-based architecture, aligned with LangGraph's patterns.

Try accessing the API Reference directly: [Agent Core API](/api-reference#core)

[code:agent/core/graph.py]
[code:agent/core/state.py]
## Key Components

### State Management

- [`State`](/definitions/agent_core_state#class-state): Base TypedDict class for state representation
- [`StateManager`](/definitions/agent_core_state#class-statemanager): Manages state creation, validation, and merging
- [`MessageState`](/definitions/agent_core_state#class-messagestate): Specialized state type for message-based interactions
- Reducer functions: [`default_reducer`](/definitions/agent_core_state#function-default_reducer), [`add_to_list`](/definitions/agent_core_state#function-add_to_list) for state updates

### Graph Implementation

- [`GraphBuilder`](/definitions/agent_core_graph#class-graphbuilder): Builder for creating computation graphs
- [`Graph`](/definitions/agent_core_graph#class-graph): A computational graph for processing state through nodes
- [`START`](/definitions/agent_core_graph) and [`END`](/definitions/agent_core_graph): Constants for graph entry and exit points
- Support for conditional edges and node transitions

### Agent Interfaces

- [`AgentInterface`](/definitions/agent_core_agent#class-agentinterface): Protocol defining required methods for agents
- [`BaseAgent`](/definitions/agent_core_agent#class-baseagent): Abstract base class for agent implementations
- [`RunnableAgent`](/definitions/agent_core_agent#class-runnableagent): Agent implementation that wraps a LangChain Runnable
- [`FunctionAgent`](/definitions/agent_core_agent#class-functionagent): Agent implementation that wraps a function

## LangGraph Alignment

This implementation has been updated to align with LangGraph's architecture:

1. **State Management**: Uses TypedDict with annotations for state definition, similar to LangGraph's approach.

2. **Reducer Functions**: Supports reducer functions for state updates, allowing for specialized handling of state attributes.

3. **Conditional Edges**: Supports conditional transitions between nodes based on state evaluation.

4. **Compilation Step**: Includes a compilation step via the `compile()` method, matching LangGraph's pattern.

5. **Entry and Exit Points**: Uses explicit entry and exit points for graph execution.

6. **State Checkpointing**: Provides basic infrastructure for state checkpointing.

## Usage Example

See the `src/agent/examples/simple_graph.py` file for a complete example of how to use these components to build a simple conversational agent.

```python
# Create a graph builder
builder = GraphBuilder(ConversationState)

# Add nodes
builder.add_node("user_input", user_input)
builder.add_node("ai_response", ai_response)

# Add edges
builder.add_edge(START, "user_input")
builder.add_edge("user_input", "ai_response")

# Add conditional edge for looping
builder.add_conditional_edge("ai_response", should_continue, "user_input")
builder.add_edge("ai_response", END)

# Set entry and finish points
builder.set_entry_point("user_input")
builder.set_finish_point("ai_response")

# Build the graph
graph = builder.compile()
