Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Sourcing Agent system - a graph-based agent framework aligned with LangGraph's architecture and patterns.

## Overview

The Sourcing Agent is a powerful framework for building and deploying AI agents using a graph-based approach. It provides a structured way to create, compose, and orchestrate complex agent workflows with explicit state management and typed interfaces.

### Key Features

- **Graph-Based Architecture**: Build agent workflows as explicit graphs with nodes and edges
- **Typed State Management**: Utilize TypedDict and annotation-based state handling
- **Modular Components**: Compose complex behaviors from reusable node implementations
- **Tool Integration**: Seamless integration with various tools and external services
- **LangGraph Alignment**: Designed to be compatible with LangGraph patterns and concepts

## Recent Enhancements

### State Management

- **TypedDict Instead of Pydantic**: Switched from Pydantic models to TypedDict for state representation, following LangGraph's approach
- **Reducer Functions**: Added support for reducer functions via Annotated types, allowing specialized handling of state attributes
- **State Channels**: Implemented state channels for communication between nodes

### Graph Implementation

- **Conditional Edges**: Added support for conditional transitions between nodes based on state evaluation
- **START and END Constants**: Introduced explicit constants for graph entry and exit points
- **Compilation Step**: Added a compilation step via the `compile()` method, matching LangGraph's pattern
- **Entry and Exit Points**: Implemented explicit entry and finish points for graph execution

### Agent Interfaces

- **RunnableAgent**: Added a new agent implementation that wraps LangChain Runnables
- **FunctionAgent**: Added a new agent implementation that wraps functions
- **Generic Support**: Enhanced type safety with generic type parameters

## Documentation Sections

### Architecture and Design

- [Architecture Flows](./Architecture_Flows) - Comprehensive flow diagrams showing how components interact
- [Module Dependencies](./Module_Dependencies) - Visualizations of dependencies between modules and packages
- [System Flows](./System_Flows) - Detailed system-level flow diagrams 
- [Component Interfaces](./Component_Interfaces) - API references and interface specifications

### Core Components

- [Graph Engine](./Graph_Engine) - Manages the execution flow of the agent system using LangGraph patterns
- [State Management](./State_Management) - Handles state creation, validation, and transformation with typesafe operations
- [Agent Tools](./Agent_Tools) - Provides standardized agent interfaces and implementations for different agent types

### Node Types

The Sourcing Agent system implements various specialized node types:

- **Main Node** - Entry point for agent execution, determines workflow paths
- **Research Node** - Handles research and information gathering using search tools
- **Market Node** - Performs market analysis on research data
- **Analysis Node** - Conducts data analysis and generates insights
- **Error Node** - Handles error detection and recovery strategies
- **Validation Node** - Validates state and ensures data integrity
- **Quality Evaluation Node** - Assesses output quality and suggests improvements

### Tools and Services

- **Search Tools** - Tools for performing web searches and retrieving information
- **Evaluation Tools** - Assessment tools for content quality and factual accuracy
- **Scraping Tools** - Tools for extracting structured data from web pages
- **Storage Tools** - Tools for persisting and retrieving data
- **Base Tool Framework** - Foundation for all tool implementations with standardized interfaces

## Getting Started

To get started with the Sourcing Agent system, we recommend:

1. First, read the [Technical Manual](./Technical_Manual) to understand the system architecture
2. Explore the [Development Guide](./Development_Guide) for setup and development workflows
3. Understand the [Graph Engine](./Graph_Engine) to learn how to construct agent workflows
4. Review the [System Flows](./System_Flows) to see how components interact in real scenarios

## Development Guidelines

When developing with or extending the Sourcing Agent system, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Modular Design** - Keep components modular and follow single responsibility principle
2. **Type Safety** - Use proper type annotations for all functions and classes
3. **Error Handling** - Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. **Testing** - Ensure all components have appropriate tests
5. **Documentation** - Document all public functions, classes, and modules

By following these guidelines, you'll help maintain the quality and maintainability of the codebase.
