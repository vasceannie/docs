The Sourcing Agent now integrates with Brave Search API's advanced endpoints to provide enhanced research capabilities:

1. **Brave Summarizer API** - Generate AI-powered summaries of complex topics
2. **Brave News API** - Find recent news articles and industry developments

## Environment Setup

To use these features, set the following environment variables:

```bash
# Required for all Brave API features
BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your-brave-api-key

# Endpoints for standard web search and content
BRAVE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT=https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search
BRAVE_WEB_ENDPOINT=https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/content

# New endpoints for summarizer and news
BRAVE_SUMMARIZER_ENDPOINT=https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/summarizer/search
BRAVE_NEWS_ENDPOINT=https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/news/search
```

## Tool Capabilities

### Summarizer Tool

The `summarize_research` tool provides AI-generated summaries of search results with key topics identified:

- Input: Search query string
- Output: Summary text, key topics, and source information (5 sources per query)
- Usage: Best for complex technical topics that need concise explanation

Example:

```json
{
  "summary": "The latest developments in electric vehicle technology highlight advancements in battery storage, improved charging infrastructure, and longer range capabilities as detailed sources confirm continuous innovation.",
  "key_topics": ["Electric Vehicles", "Battery Technology", "Charging Infrastructure"],
  "search_results": [
    {
      "title": "Revolutionary Battery Designs Propel Electric Vehicles",
      "url": "https://technews.example.com/electric-vehicles",
      "description": "An in-depth review of the latest battery innovations transforming the electric vehicle industry.",
      "source": "Tech News Daily"
    },
    {
      "title": "Charging Stations Set to Multiply Across Cities",
      "url": "https://energyevolution.example.com/charging-infrastructure",
      "description": "New public and private investments are driving the expansion of charging networks in urban areas.",
      "source": "Energy Evolution"
    },
    {
      "title": "Electric Cars Gain Longer Range with Next-Gen Engines",
      "url": "https://autoinnovation.example.com/new-electric-range",
      "description": "Exploring the impact of improved engine designs on extending the drive range of modern electric vehicles.",
      "source": "Auto Innovation"
    },
    {
      "title": "Tech Giants Invest in Sustainable Mobility Solutions",
      "url": "https://sustainability.example.com/mobility-solutions",
      "description": "A roundup of major tech companies investing in sustainable and innovative mobility projects.",
      "source": "Sustainability Insights"
    },
    {
      "title": "Market Analysis: Electric Vehicle Trends of 2023",
      "url": "https://marketwatch.example.com/ev-trends",
      "description": "Data-driven analysis on the growth and future trends in the electric vehicle marketplace.",
      "source": "Market Watch"
    }
  ]
}

### News Search Tool

The `search_news` tool provides recent news articles related to the query:

- Input: Search query string, freshness parameter ("h", "d", "w", "m")
- Output: List of news articles with titles, URLs, descriptions, and sources (5 articles per query)
- Usage: Best for finding recent developments, market trends, and industry news

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "News Article Title",
    "url": "https://news-source.com/article",
    "description": "Article description",
    "published_date": "2023-07-15T12:00:00Z",
    "source": "News Source"
  }
  // ... 4 more articles
]
```

## Integration with Research Workflow

The tools are integrated into the agent's research workflow and can be used to:

1. Find general information with `search_web` (3 results per query)
2. Get recent developments with `search_news` (5 results per query)
3. Summarize complex topics with `summarize_research` (5 sources per query)
4. Extract detailed content with `scrape_website`

## Rate Limiting

The tools use the following rate limiting configuration:

- Web search: 3 results per query
- Summarizer: 5 results per query
- News search: 5 results per query
- 5 requests per second for web APIs (including summarizer and news)
- Timeout set to 30 seconds per request

## Citation Handling

All results from the tools are automatically added as citations:

- Web search results are added with title, URL, and description
- Summarizer results include both the AI summary and all 5 source articles
- News results include title, URL, description, source, and publication date

## Error Handling

The tools include comprehensive error handling:

- Configuration validation
- API error responses
- Timeout handling
- Proper logging of all errors

If the API key or endpoints are not configured, the tools will return appropriate error messages.
