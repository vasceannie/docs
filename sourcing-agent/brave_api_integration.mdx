# Brave Search API Integration

The Sourcing Agent now integrates with Brave Search API's advanced endpoints to provide enhanced research capabilities:

1. **Brave Summarizer API** - Generate AI-powered summaries of complex topics
2. **Brave News API** - Find recent news articles and industry developments

## Environment Setup

To use these features, set the following environment variables:

```bash
# Required for all Brave API features
BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your-brave-api-key

# Endpoints for standard web search and content
BRAVE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT=https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search
BRAVE_WEB_ENDPOINT=https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/content

# New endpoints for summarizer and news
BRAVE_SUMMARIZER_ENDPOINT=https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/summarizer/search
BRAVE_NEWS_ENDPOINT=https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/news/search

## Tool Capabilities

### Summarizer Tool

The `summarize_research` tool provides AI-generated summaries of search results with key topics identified:

- Output: Summary text, key topics, and source information (5 sources per query)
- Usage: Best for complex technical topics that need concise explanation

Example:

```json
{
  "summary": "The latest developments in electric vehicle technology highlight advancements in battery storage, improved charging infrastructure, and longer range capabilities as detailed sources confirm continuous innovation.",
  "key_topics": ["Electric Vehicles", "Battery Technology", "Charging Infrastructure"],
  "search_results": [
    {
      "title": "Revolutionary Battery Designs Propel Electric Vehicles",
