This project uses a modern Python development environment with `uv` for fast, reliable package management and virtual environments, along with Node.js tools for additional functionality.

## Prerequisites

- Linux/Unix-based system
- `curl`
- `make`
- `sudo` access (for npm installation)
- Internet connection

## Quick Start

```bash
# Complete setup
make setup
source ~/.bashrc
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run tests
make test

# Format and lint code
make format
make lint
```bash

## Detailed Setup Process

### 1. Environment Setup

The project uses a Makefile to automate the development environment setup. The main components are:

- **uv**: A fast package installer and resolver for Python
- **Python 3.12**: Latest stable Python version
- **Virtual Environment**: Isolated Python environment for project dependencies
- **langgraph-cli**: LangGraph CLI tool with in-memory support
- **npm**: Node.js package manager (v20.x)
- **repomix**: Repository analysis and management tool
- **Development Tools**: Ruff for linting/formatting, mypy for type checking, pytest for testing

### 2. Available Make Commands

#### Environment Management

```bash
make setup         # Complete setup (uv + venv + dependencies + npm + repomix)
make install-uv    # Install only uv package manager
make create-venv   # Create only Python virtual environment
make install-deps  # Install project dependencies
make install-npm   # Install npm (Node.js v20.x)
make install-repomix # Install repomix globally
make clean         # Remove virtual environment and clean npm cache
```bash

#### Development Commands

```bash
# Testing
make test                      # Run unit tests
make test TEST_FILE=<file>     # Run specific test file
make test_watch               # Run tests in watch mode
make integration_tests        # Run integration tests
make extended_tests          # Run extended test suite
make test_profile           # Run tests with profiling

# Code Quality
make format                  # Format code
make lint                    # Run all linters
make lint_package           # Lint source code only
make lint_tests            # Lint test code only
make spell_check          # Check spelling
make spell_fix           # Fix spelling errors
make sonar              # Run SonarQube analysis
```bash

### 3. Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Install uv and Create Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   make setup
   ```bash

   This will:
   
   - Install the uv package manager
   - Add uv to your PATH
   - Create a Python 3.12 virtual environment
   - Install langgraph-cli and other dependencies

2. **Update Your PATH**:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```bash

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```bash

   Your prompt should change to indicate the virtual environment is active.

4. **Installing Additional Dependencies**:
   With the virtual environment activated, use uv to install packages:

   ```bash
   uv pip install <package-name>
   ```bash

### 4. Project Dependencies

The setup automatically installs:

- **langgraph-cli[inmem]**: LangGraph CLI tool with in-memory support
- **Node.js Components**:
  - Node.js v20.x: Latest LTS version
  - npm: Node.js package manager
  - repomix: Repository analysis tool
- **Development Dependencies**:
  - pytest: Testing framework
  - ruff: Fast Python linter and formatter
  - mypy: Static type checker
  - codespell: Spell checker
  - pytest-watch: Test watcher

### 5. Development Workflow

1. **Starting Development**:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate    # Activate virtual environment
   ```bash

2. **Before Committing Changes**:

   ```bash
   make format                  # Format code
   make lint                    # Check for issues
   make test                    # Run tests
   ```bash

3. **Running Specific Tests**:

   ```bash
   make test TEST_FILE=tests/unit_tests/test_specific.py
   ```bash

4. **Continuous Test Development**:

   ```bash
   make test_watch             # Watches for changes and runs tests
   ```bash

5. **Ending Development**:

   ```bash
   deactivate                  # Exit virtual environment
   ```bash

### 6. Running LangGraph Development Server

To run the LangGraph development server with hot reloading:

1. **Ensure Virtual Environment is Active**:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```bash

2. **Start the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   langgraph dev
   ```bash

   This will:
   
   - Start the server in development mode
   - Enable hot reloading (automatic restart on code changes)
   - Open your default browser automatically
   - Use default port (typically 8000)

3. **Common Options**:

   ```bash
   # Custom port
   langgraph dev --port 3000

   # Prevent browser from opening automatically
   langgraph dev --no-browser

   # Disable hot reloading
   langgraph dev --no-reload

   # Enable remote debugging
   langgraph dev --debug-port 5678

   # Custom host (be cautious with 0.0.0.0)
   langgraph dev --host 127.0.0.1

   # Specify maximum concurrent jobs per worker
   langgraph dev --n-jobs-per-worker 5
   ```bash

4. **Using a Configuration File**:
   If you have a custom configuration file:

   ```bash
   langgraph dev --config path/to/config.yaml
   ```bash

5. **Debugging**:
   To enable remote debugging:

   ```bash
   # Install debugpy
   uv pip install debugpy

   # Run with debug port
   langgraph dev --debug-port 5678 --wait-for-client
   ```bash

### 7. Maintenance

- **Cleaning Up**: To remove the virtual environment and start fresh:

  ```bash
  make clean
  ```bash

- **Reinstalling**: To reinstall everything:

  ```bash
  make clean
  make setup
  ```bash

## Why This Setup?

- **uv**: Significantly faster than pip, with improved dependency resolution
- **Python 3.12**: Latest stable version with performance improvements and new features
- **Makefile**: Standardizes setup process and development commands across machines
- **Virtual Environment**: Isolates project dependencies from system Python
- **langgraph-cli**: Provides essential LangGraph functionality with in-memory support
- **Node.js & npm**: Enables use of JavaScript/Node.js tools and utilities
- **repomix**: Powerful tool for repository analysis and management
- **Ruff**: Fast, comprehensive Python linter and formatter
- **mypy**: Ensures type safety across the codebase
- **pytest**: Robust testing framework with excellent plugin ecosystem

## Code Quality with SonarQube

This project is configured to use SonarQube for code quality analysis. SonarQube helps identify code smells, bugs, vulnerabilities, and technical debt.

### Setup SonarQube

1. **SonarQube Server**: You need access to a SonarQube server. You can:

   - Use a hosted SonarQube instance
   - Run SonarQube locally with Docker:

     ```bash
     docker run -d --name sonarqube -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:latest
     ```bash

   - Access the SonarQube UI at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) (default credentials: admin/admin)

2. **Configure Authentication**:

   - Generate a token in SonarQube (User > My Account > Security > Generate Tokens)
   - Set the token in your environment:

     ```bash
     export SONAR_LOGIN=your-token-here
     export SONAR_HOST_URL=http://localhost:9000  # Adjust if using a different server
     ```bash

### Running Analysis

Run the SonarQube analysis with:

```bash
make sonar
```bash

This will:

1. Run tests with coverage (generates coverage.xml)
2. Execute the SonarScanner with the project configuration
3. Upload results to your SonarQube server

> **Note**: The project has a test coverage requirement of 70%. The current coverage is around 24%, which means the `make sonar` command will show a coverage failure. This is expected and does not prevent the SonarQube analysis from running.

### Manual Configuration

If needed, you can customize the analysis by editing:

- `sonar-project.properties` - Project configuration
- `run-sonar-scan.sh` - Scanner execution script

## Troubleshooting

1. **uv not found**:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # Reload shell configuration
   ```bash

2. **Python version issues**:

   ```bash
   make clean        # Remove existing environment
   make create-venv  # Create fresh environment
   ```bash

3. **PATH issues**:

   - Verify PATH includes `/root/.local/bin`
   - Run `echo $PATH` to check

4. **Dependency issues**:

   ```bash
   make clean        # Remove existing environment
   make setup        # Fresh install of everything
   ```bash

5. **Linter/Formatter issues**:

   ```bash
   make install-deps # Reinstall development dependencies
   ```bash

6. **npm/Node.js issues**:

   ```bash
   # Check Node.js installation
   node --version
   npm --version
   
   # Reinstall Node.js and npm
   make install-npm
   
   # Clear npm cache and reinstall repomix
   make clean
   make install-repomix
   ```bash
