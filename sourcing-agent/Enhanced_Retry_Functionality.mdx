This document describes the enhanced retry functionality available in the agent system, including timeout handling, callback tracking, and retry statistics.

## Basic Usage

The `async_retry` decorator provides robust retry capabilities for async functions:

```python
from agent.utils import async_retry

@async_retry(max_retries=3, base_delay=1.0)
async def my_flaky_function(arg1, arg2):
    # This function will be retried up to 3 times
    # with exponential backoff starting at 1 second
    result = await some_external_api_call(arg1, arg2)
    return result
```

## Timeout Support

You can now specify a timeout for each individual attempt:

```python
@async_retry(max_retries=3, base_delay=1.0, timeout=5.0)
async def my_function_with_timeout():
    # Each attempt will timeout after 5 seconds
    result = await potentially_slow_operation()
    return result
```

This ensures that your function calls don't hang indefinitely, which is particularly important when dealing with external APIs that might not respond in a timely manner.

## Callback Tracking

The enhanced retry mechanism now supports callbacks when retries occur:

```python
def my_retry_handler(attempt, exception):
    print(f"Attempt {attempt} failed with: {type(exception).__name__}: {str(exception)}")
    # Log or track the retry...

@async_retry(
    max_retries=3, 
    base_delay=1.0, 
    on_retry=my_retry_handler
)
async def my_monitored_function():
    # This function will invoke my_retry_handler on each retry
    result = await some_operation()
    return result
```

## Retry Statistics

The system now includes a comprehensive retry statistics tracking module:

```python
from agent.retry_stats import create_retry_tracker, get_retry_stats

# 1. Create a decorated function with statistics tracking
@async_retry(
    max_retries=3,
    base_delay=1.0,
    on_retry=create_retry_tracker("my_critical_function")
)
async def my_critical_function():
    # Operations will be tracked
    pass

# 2. Call the function (potentially from multiple places)
await my_critical_function()
await my_critical_function()

# 3. Get retry statistics
stats = await get_retry_stats("my_critical_function")
print(f"Success rate: {stats['success_rate']:.2%}")
print(f"Average retries per call: {stats['avg_retries_per_call']:.2f}")
print(f"Most common exceptions: {stats['exception_counts']}")
```

### Available Statistics

The following statistics are available for each tracked function:

- `total_calls`: Total number of calls to the function
- `successful_calls`: Number of calls that eventually succeeded
- `failed_calls`: Number of calls that failed even after retries
- `retried_calls`: Number of calls that required at least one retry
- `total_retries`: Total number of retries across all calls
- `success_rate`: Percentage of calls that succeeded
- `retry_rate`: Percentage of calls that required retries
- `avg_retries_per_call`: Average number of retries per call
- `avg_time_per_call`: Average time per call (including retries)
- `exception_counts`: Counts of each type of exception encountered
- `recent_events`: List of recent retry events with timing information

### Resetting Statistics

You can reset statistics for a specific function or all functions:

```python
from agent.retry_stats import reset_retry_stats

# Reset stats for a specific function
await reset_retry_stats("my_critical_function")

# Reset all retry statistics
await reset_retry_stats()
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always set appropriate timeouts** for functions that call external services to prevent hanging operations.

2. **Use specific exception types** in `retry_on` to only retry on expected transient failures:

   ```python
   @async_retry(
       max_retries=3,
       retry_on=(aiohttp.ClientError, asyncio.TimeoutError)
   )
   ```

3. **Use the statistics tracking** for critical or problematic functions to identify patterns in failures.

4. **Set reasonable backoff parameters** to prevent overwhelming services during recovery:
   - `base_delay`: Starting delay between retries
   - `max_delay`: Maximum delay between retries

5. **Keep retry counts low** (2-3) for user-facing operations and higher (5+) for background tasks where latency is less critical.

## Performance Considerations

The enhanced retry functionality is designed to have minimal overhead:

- Timeout handling uses asyncio's built-in mechanisms
- The callback system only executes on retries, not on every call
- Statistics tracking happens asynchronously to avoid blocking the main function

## Examples

### API Client with Retries and Monitoring

```python
from agent.utils import async_retry
from agent.retry_stats import create_retry_tracker

class APIClient:
    def __init__(self, base_url):
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.session = None
    
    async def ensure_session(self):
        if self.session is None or self.session.closed:
            self.session = aiohttp.ClientSession()
        return self.session
    
    @async_retry(
        max_retries=3,
        base_delay=1.0,
        max_delay=10.0,
        timeout=30.0,
        retry_on=(aiohttp.ClientError, asyncio.TimeoutError),
        on_retry=create_retry_tracker("api_client.get_data")
    )
    async def get_data(self, endpoint):
        session = await self.ensure_session()
        async with session.get(f"{self.base_url}/{endpoint}") as response:
            response.raise_for_status()
            return await response.json()
```

### Scheduled Monitoring

```python
from agent.retry_stats import get_retry_stats

async def report_retry_metrics():
    """Generate a report of retry statistics for monitoring."""
    stats = await get_retry_stats()
    
    # Report critical functions with high retry rates
    critical_functions = []
    for func_name, func_stats in stats.items():
        if func_stats["retry_rate"] > 0.1:  # More than 10% retried
            critical_functions.append({
                "function": func_name,
                "retry_rate": func_stats["retry_rate"],
                "success_rate": func_stats["success_rate"],
                "avg_retries": func_stats["avg_retries_per_call"],
                "exceptions": func_stats["exception_counts"]
            })
    
    # Sort by retry rate (highest first)
    critical_functions.sort(key=lambda x: x["retry_rate"], reverse=True)
    
    # Log or send to monitoring system
    logger.warning(f"Functions with high retry rates: {critical_functions}")
