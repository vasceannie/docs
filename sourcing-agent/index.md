## Getting Started

To get started with the Sourcing Agent system, we recommend first understanding the overall architecture and flow of the system by reading the [Architecture Flows](./Architecture_Flows.md) documentation.

## Development Guidelines

When developing with or extending the Sourcing Agent system, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Modular Design** - Keep components modular and follow single responsibility principle
2. **Type Safety** - Use proper type annotations for all functions and classes
3. **Error Handling** - Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. **Testing** - Ensure all components have appropriate tests
5. **Documentation** - Document all public functions, classes, and modules

By following these guidelines, you'll help maintain the quality and maintainability of the codebase.
