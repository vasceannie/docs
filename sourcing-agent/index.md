Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Sourcing Agent system. This documentation provides detailed information about the architecture, components, and flows of the agent system.

## Documentation Sections

### Architecture and Design

- [Architecture Flows](./Architecture_Flows.md) - Comprehensive flow diagrams showing how components interact
- [Module Dependencies](./Module_Dependencies.md) - Visualizations of dependencies between modules and packages
- [System Flows](./System_Flows.md) - Detailed system-level flow diagrams 
- [Component Interfaces](./Component_Interfaces.md) - API references and interface specifications

### Core Components

- **Graph Engine** - Manages the execution flow of the agent system using LangGraph patterns
- **State Management** - Handles state creation, validation, and transformation with typesafe operations
- **Agent Interface** - Provides standardized agent interfaces and implementations for different agent types

### Node Types

- **Main Node** - Entry point for agent execution, determines workflow paths
- **Research Node** - Handles research and information gathering using search tools
- **Market Node** - Performs market analysis on research data
- **Analysis Node** - Conducts data analysis and generates insights
- **Error Node** - Handles error detection and recovery strategies
- **Validation Node** - Validates state and ensures data integrity
- **Quality Evaluation Node** - Assesses output quality and suggests improvements

### Tools and Services

- **Search Tools** - Tools for performing web searches and retrieving information
- **Evaluation Tools** - Assessment tools for content quality and factual accuracy
- **Scraping Tools** - Tools for extracting structured data from web pages
- **Storage Tools** - Tools for persisting and retrieving data
- **Base Tool Framework** - Foundation for all tool implementations with standardized interfaces

### Configuration and Settings

- **Configuration Management** - Handles system configuration and settings
- **Environment Configuration** - Manages environment-specific settings

### Error Handling and Logging

- **Error Management** - Strategies for handling errors and exceptions
- **Logging System** - Logging mechanisms and strategies
- **Retry Statistics** - Tracking system for monitoring retry operations

## Implementation Status

The following components have been implemented:

- **Core Framework**:
  - Graph implementation with node and edge management
  - State management with validation and transformation
  - Agent interfaces and base implementations

- **Tools**:
  - Base tool framework with standard interfaces
  - Search tools for web information retrieval
  - Evaluation tools for content assessment
  - Tool registry for centralized tool management

- **Nodes**:
  - Node interfaces with standardized signatures
  - Basic node implementations

Components in progress:

- **Advanced Node Logic**:
  - Deep implementation of node processing logic
  - Cross-node state management

- **Integration Services**:
  - External API integrations
  - Database connectors

## Getting Started

To get started with the Sourcing Agent system, we recommend first understanding the overall architecture and flow of the system by reading the [Architecture Flows](./Architecture_Flows.md) documentation.

## Development Guidelines

When developing with or extending the Sourcing Agent system, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Modular Design** - Keep components modular and follow single responsibility principle
2. **Type Safety** - Use proper type annotations for all functions and classes
3. **Error Handling** - Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. **Testing** - Ensure all components have appropriate tests
5. **Documentation** - Document all public functions, classes, and modules

By following these guidelines, you'll help maintain the quality and maintainability of the codebase.
