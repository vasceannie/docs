This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up the development environment and working with the Sourcing Agent codebase.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

### System Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 20+ (for documentation)
- Git

### Initial Setup

Clone the repository and set up the development environment using our Makefile:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RiseNow-Dev/sourcing-agent.git
cd sourcing-agent

# Run the setup script which includes:
# - checking dependencies
# - installing the uv package manager
# - creating a virtual environment
# - installing dependencies
# - setting up npm and repomix
make setup
```

Alternatively, you can follow these manual steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RiseNow-Dev/sourcing-agent.git
cd sourcing-agent

# Install uv package manager
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create a Python virtual environment
uv venv -p 3.12

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
uv pip install "langgraph-cli[inmem]"
```

### Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and update it with your settings:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to include your API keys and configuration settings.

## Development Workflow

### Code Formatting and Linting

We use `ruff` for code formatting and linting. Run the following commands to ensure your code meets our standards:

```bash
# Format code
make format

# Run linters
make lint
```

### Running Tests

Run the test suite to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality:

```bash
# Run all unit tests
make test

# Run integration tests
make integration_tests

# Run tests with coverage reporting
make test_coverage

# Run tests with HTML coverage report
make test_coverage_html
```

### Project Structure

The Sourcing Agent project has the following structure:

```
sourcing-agent/
├── documentation/      # Documentation files
├── examples/           # Example code and usage examples
├── src/                # Source code
│   └── agent/          # Agent implementation
│       ├── checkpoints/    # State persistence
│       ├── cli/            # Command-line interfaces
│       ├── config/         # Configuration management
│       ├── core/           # Core framework components
│       ├── nodes/          # Node implementations
│       ├── prompts/        # Prompt templates
│       ├── reflection/     # Self-assessment mechanisms
│       ├── services/       # External service integrations
│       ├── subgraphs/      # Reusable graph components
│       ├── supervisors/    # Agent orchestration
│       ├── tools/          # Tool implementations
│       └── utils/          # Utility functions
├── tests/              # Test suite
│   ├── integration_tests/  # Integration tests
│   └── unit_tests/         # Unit tests
└── workflows/          # CI/CD workflows
```

To visualize the project structure, you can use:

```bash
# Show project structure
make tree

# Show Python files structure
make tree-py

# Show tests structure
make tree-tests
```

## Building the Documentation

The documentation is built using Mintlify. To preview the documentation locally:

1. Install Mintlify CLI:
   ```bash
   npm i -g mintlify
   ```

2. Start the documentation server:
   ```bash
   cd documentation
   mintlify dev
   ```

The documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Branch Strategy

1. Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```

2. Keep your branches focused on a single task.

3. Regularly pull from the main branch to stay up-to-date.

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass locally.
2. Update documentation to reflect your changes.
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes.

### Code Review Guidelines

- Address all review comments.
- Maintain code quality standards.
- Ensure all CI checks pass.

## Performance Testing

For performance-critical components, we use benchmarks to track performance:

```bash
# Run benchmarks
make test_benchmark

# Compare with previous benchmark results
make test_benchmark_compare
```

## Debugging Tips

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Dependencies**: If you encounter import errors, ensure you've installed all dependencies with `make install-deps`.

2. **Environment Variables**: Many components require API keys or configuration values set in the `.env` file.

3. **Type Errors**: We use strict typing. Run `make lint` to catch type issues early.

### Debugging Tools

- Use the built-in Python debugger or VS Code's debugger.
- Enable DEBUG level logging by setting `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` in your `.env` file.
- Use `make test_profile` to identify performance bottlenecks.
