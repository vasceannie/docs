By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port Mintlify runs on by using the `--port` flag. To run Mintlify on port 3333, for instance, use this command:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Mintlify Versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local website doesn't align with the production version, please update the CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Validating Links

The CLI can assist with validating reference links made in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Pro
  Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing) and above.
</Tip>

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/checks-passed.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

## Code Formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>

    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:
    1. Remove the currently-installed version of mintlify: `npm remove -g mintlify`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall mintlify: `npm install -g mintlify`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
  
    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the \~/.mintlify folder. Afterwards, run `mintlify dev` again.
