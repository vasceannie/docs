"""Async utilities for concurrency control, retry mechanisms, and rate limiting.

This module provides functionality for asynchronous operations in the agent framework,
including concurrency control, function conversion, retry mechanisms with exponential
backoff, and rate limiting for API calls.

Typical usage examples:
    # Run multiple coroutines with concurrency limit
    results = await gather_with_concurrency(5, *my_coroutines)

    # Convert a synchronous function to asynchronous
    asyn...
